    "Functions are useful when you want to repeat a series of steps on multiple different objects, but don't want to type out the steps over and over again. Many functions are built into Python already; for example, you've already made use of `len()` to retrieve the number of elements in a list. You can also write your own functions, and at this point you already have the skills to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions generally take a set of __parameters__ (also called inputs), which define the objects they will use when they are run. For example, the `len()` function takes a list or array as its parameter, and returns the length of that list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a function that takes two parameters, compares them somehow, and then returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`) depending on the comparison. The `is_multiple` function below takes as parameters an integer `m` and an integer `n`, checks if `m` is a multiple of `n`, and returns `True` if it is. Otherwise, it returns `False`. \n",
    "\n",
    "`if` statements, just like `while` loops, are dependent on boolean expressions. If the conditional is `True`, then the following indented code block will be executed. If the conditional evaluates to `False`, then the code block will be skipped over. Read more about `if` statements [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_if_else.htm).\n",

    "Below, we will use the modulus operator `%`. \n",
